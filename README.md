# pyNutrition
Offline nutrition recorder
I created this side-project because I wanted a privacy oriented alternative to common fitness applications. This allows the user to store their data on their own computer.

#  Definition of Terms
* Grocery = A grocery can be 100g of bread from brand X and the nutritional values for 100g of bread from brand X. 
* Portion = The actual consumed amount of a grocery, e.g. 35g of bread from brand X. The program will calculate 35g using the recorded grocery.
* Meal = All portions consumed for Breakfast (Lunch or Dinner or any number of meals selected by the user).

# Short-term goals:
1. Allow the user to store groceries and record the Brandname and fullname of each grocery, the amount, carbs, protein, fat and sugar.
3. Allow the user to choose from all recorded groceries and select one to be used as the basis of a portion.
4. Calculate and record the chosen portion.
2. Calculate the totals of all portions in a day and present it.
3. Allow user to set a calorie goal.
4. Allow user to set crabs, protein, fat goal.
5. Allow the user to split portions into meals (adding 4 portions to Breakfast for example).
6. Allow the user to track water and set a water goal.

# Long-term goals
In no particular order:
Allow the user to pick sizes of each portion. Create the grocery with all values and an amount and save it in the grocery database. Create a portion and select 10g of butter. Have the program calculate what 10g would be if the grocery's amount is set to 100g or similar.
Allow the user to track portions weekly, monthly, yearly.
Present portions by date as far back as the user has recorded them.
