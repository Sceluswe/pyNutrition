# pyNutrition
Offline nutrition recorder
I created this side-project because I wanted a privacy oriented alternative to common fitness applications. This allows the user to store their data on their own computer.

#  Definition of Terms
* Food Item = A food item can be 100g of bread from brand X and the nutritional values for 100g of bread from brand X. 
* Portion = The actual consumed amount of a food item, e.g. 35g of bread from brand X. The program will calculate 35g using the recorded food item.
* Meal = All portions consumed for Breakfast (Lunch or Dinner or any number of meals selected by the user).

# Short-term goals:
1. Allow the user to store portions and record nutritional values for each portion.
2. Record the Brandname and fullname of each portion, the amount, carbs, protein and fat and sugar.
2. Calculate the totals of all portions in a day and present it.
3. Allow user to set calorie goal.
4. Allow user to set crabs, protein, fat goal.
5. Allow the user to split portions into meals (adding 4 portions to Breakfast for example).
6. Allow the user to track water and set a water goal.

# Long-term goals
In no particular order:
Allow the user to pick sizes of each portion. Create the food item with all values and an amount and save it in the food item database. Create a portion and select 10g of butter. Have the program calculate what 10g would be if the food item's amount is set to 100g or similar.
Allow the user to track portions weekly, monthly, yearly.
Present portions by date as far back as the user has recorded them.
