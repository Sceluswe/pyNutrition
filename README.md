# pyNutrition
Offline nutrition recorder
I created this side-project because I wanted a privacy oriented alternative to common fitness applications. This allows the user to store their data on their own computer.

#Short-term goals:
1. Allow the user to store portions and record nutritional values for each portion (portion = a single consumed item e.g. 10g of butter OR a slice of bread).
2. Calculate the totals of all portions in a day and present it.
3. Allow user to set calorie goal.
4. Allow user to set crabs, protein, fat goal.
5. Allow the user to split portions into meals (adding 4 portions to Breakfast for example).
6. Allow the user to track water and set a water goal.

#Long-term goals
In no particular order:
Allow the user to track portions weekly, monthly, yearly.
Present portions by date as far back as the user has recorded them.
